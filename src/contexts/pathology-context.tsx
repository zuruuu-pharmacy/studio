        specialty: "Neuropathology",
        findings: "Blood tests are positive for antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Electromyography (EMG) shows a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation. A biopsy of a muscle is not typically needed for diagnosis but would show simplified postsynaptic membranes and a reduced number of AChRs.",
        diagnosis: "Myasthenia Gravis.",
        discussion: "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This impairs neuromuscular transmission, leading to the characteristic fluctuating, fatigable muscle weakness. The disease is often associated with abnormalities of the thymus gland (hyperplasia or thymoma).",

        discussion: "Fibrocystic change is an extremely common, benign condition and represents an exaggerated physiological response of the breast tissue to cyclic hormonal changes. It is not a single disease but a spectrum of changes. It is important to distinguish nonproliferative changes (like simple cysts and fibrosis) from proliferative changes, some of which (proliferative disease with atypia) confer a small increased risk for subsequent breast cancer.",
